# Artistic-Style-Transfer-Dashtoon

This repository contains code for neural style transfer using PyTorch.

## Overview

Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images — a content image and a style reference image — and blend them together in such a way that the output image looks like the content image, but "painted" in the style of the style reference image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-style-transfer.git
   cd neural-style-transfer
